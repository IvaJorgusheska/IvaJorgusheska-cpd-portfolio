        <h4>Machine Learning Laboratory – Linear Classification and Optimization Analysis</h4>
        <p>This lab focused on the mathematical foundations of machine learning, particularly linear classification and optimization through gradient descent. I derived the gradient of the hinge loss function with L2 regularization step-by-step, expressed it in vectorized form, and formulated the weight update equation analytically. The study examined how the learning rate affects convergence, cost reduction, and classification accuracy across training and testing sets. In the second part, I applied these principles to a neural network model for air quality prediction, analyzing optimizer performance (SGD vs. ADAM) and validating convergence behavior. The work demonstrated strong understanding of mathematical modeling, derivative computation, and optimization dynamics in supervised learning.</p>

        <h4>Features for Estimating Autonomous Vehicle Poses</h4>
        <p>Implemented and analyzed feature-matching algorithms for visual odometry (VO) in autonomous vehicle navigation using the KITTI dataset. Developed three matching strategies—distance thresholding, nearest neighbour, and nearest neighbour distance ratio (NNDR)—to estimate vehicle trajectories through sequential image analysis. Using SIFT-based keypoint detection and OpenCV’s BFMatcher, I compared feature similarity metrics to improve pose estimation accuracy. The work demonstrated how robust feature correspondence underpins reliable VO performance, particularly in complex, real-world motion scenarios. This project strengthened my understanding of computer vision, geometric reasoning, and the link between low-level image features and high-level motion inference in autonomous systems.</p>

        <h4>Reversi Game Agent – Minimax with Alpha–Beta Pruning</h4>
        <p>In this project, I implemented an intelligent Reversi (Othello) game agent in Java, designing a minimax search algorithm enhanced with alpha–beta pruning to optimize decision-making efficiency. The agent evaluates board states using a heuristic evaluation function that weights positional advantages such as corners and edge stability. I engineered an efficient recursive search procedure with adjustable depth control and pruning to minimize computational overhead while maintaining strategic accuracy. The program consistently outperformed baseline agents using random or sequential move selection, demonstrating the effectiveness of pruning in reducing search complexity. This project strengthened my understanding of game tree exploration, heuristic optimization, and AI search algorithms for adversarial environments.</p>

        <h4>Constraint Satisfaction and Pandiagonal Magic Squares</h4>
        <p>This project focused on applying constraint satisfaction techniques to logic-based and mathematical problems using Python’s constraint module. I modelled complex problems — including a traveller scheduling puzzle and the generation of magic and pandiagonal magic squares — as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). I designed constraints defining variable dependencies, mutual exclusions, and arithmetic relationships, enabling the solver to identify consistent solutions efficiently. Through this, I demonstrated strong logical reasoning, formal problem abstraction, and the ability to translate natural language conditions into precise computational rules. The project deepened my understanding of search space reduction, CSP heuristics, and computational logic in AI problem-solving.</p>

        <p>Developed in collaboration with a colleague, this project focused on predicting hypothesis–premise relationships within Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks. Through extensive research on the strengths and limitations of transformer-based models, we explored innovative strategies to improve reasoning accuracy. Building on this analysis, we proposed a meta-learning architecture that aggregates probability outputs from multiple fine-tuned transformers (BERT, RoBERTa, and ALBERT) using a neural meta-learner to enhance generalization and performance. I authored detailed model cards and a poster presentation explaining the design, ethical considerations, and interpretability aspects of both solutions.

        <p>As part of a team research project, we explored sustainable alternatives to plastic food packaging by developing biodegradable antimicrobial bio-films made from starch, rosemary extract, and natural plasticizers such as sorbitol and glycerol. We produced and analyzed multiple formulations with varying acetic acid concentrations, testing their flexibility, strength, and antimicrobial properties. The resulting bio-films successfully replicated the qualities of commercial plastics while being eco-friendly and food-safe. I co-authored a 23-page report detailing the research methodology and results. The project received several international recognitions, including Silver at Euroinvent 2020 (Romania), Bronze at Inofair 2020 (USA), Bronze at Vilipo 2021 (Lithuania), and Silver at ASEF 2021 (Albania).</p>
